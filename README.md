## Classification

### Animal Classification  
[Project](https://github.com/Wilann/Animal-Classification)  
Used Supervised Learning techniques to classify animals based on their characteristics

- Preprocessed data by normalizing/scaling, and one-hot encoding
- Evaluated models based on metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F Beta Score, as well as compare them against a Naive Predictor
- Evaluated Supervised Learning techniques including Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbor, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGDC), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and chooses the best model
- Created training and predicting pipeline to quickly and efficiently train models using various sizes of training sets and perform predictions on testing data
- Tuned model using Grid Search to optimize hyperparameters
- Extracted feature importance
- Performed feature selection to get the most important features and re-trained the model
- Examined effects of feature selection by comparing the model with reduced features and optimized model
